#	registering new colormaps and for getting a colormap by name,
#	and a mixin class for adding color mapping functionality.
from matplotlib import cm

#	Provides a MATLAB-like plotting framework.
#	:mod:`~matplotlib.pylab` combines pyplot with numpy into a single namespace.
#	This is convenient for interactive work, but for programming it
#	is recommended that the namespaces be kept separate, e.g.::
#		import numpy as np
#		import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
#		x = np.arange(0, 5, 0.1);
#		y = np.sin(x)
#		plt.plot(x, y)
from matplotlib import pyplot

#	Module containing Axes3D, an object which can plot 3D objects on a
#	2D matplotlib figure.
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d

#	Provides
#		An array object of arbitrary homogeneous items
#		Fast mathematical operations over arrays
#		Linear Algebra, Fourier Transforms, Random Number Generation

#	Kernel ridge regression.
#	Kernel ridge regression (KRR) combines ridge regression (linear least
#	squares with l2-norm regularization) with the kernel trick. It thus
#	learns a linear function in the space induced by the respective kernel and
#	the data. For non-linear kernels, this corresponds to a non-linear
#	function in the original space.
#	The form of the model learned by KRR is identical to support vector
#	regression (SVR). However, different loss functions are used: KRR uses
#	squared error loss while support vector regression uses epsilon-insensitive
#	loss, both combined with l2 regularization. In contrast to SVR, fitting a
#	KRR model can be done in closed-form and is typically faster for
#	medium-sized datasets. On the other  hand, the learned model is non-sparse
#	and thus slower than SVR, which learns a sparse model for epsilon > 0, at
#	prediction-time.
#	This estimator has built-in support for multi-variate regression
#	(i.e., when y is a 2d-array of shape [n_samples, n_targets]).
from sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge

#	$R^2$ (coefficient of determination) regression score function.
#	Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the
#	model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always
#	predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features,
#	would get a $R^2$ score of 0.0.
